The Python code was created using the psutil library (https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) for retrieving hardware performance data. 
The SuperCollider code is built upon the example code from the Wekinator documentation. It includes synthesis, mapping, and communication methods used in the first presentation of the project at IEM.
